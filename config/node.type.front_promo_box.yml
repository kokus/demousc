help: 'NOTE TO PUBLISHER: In order for a Front Promo Box to appear on the homepage, you must ensure the promo node is 1.) in a published state, and 2.) the "Promoted to front page" box is checked on the published draft. Additionally, the MOST RECENTLY CREATED front promo promo box node will always appear over older/previously published nodes. To update an existing Front Promo Box so that it appears above newer promo boxes, you may click the “Clone content” link from the node page and publish the clone as a new front page promo node.'
